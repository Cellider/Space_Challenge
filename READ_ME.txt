Hi, I am Cellider.
This is a small project of mine in order to deepen my knowlodge of python. In the beginning I followed the alien_invasion project in Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes, been modifying the code according to my will ever since, as of the moment it's not completed and I plan on implementing other features, such as a boss fight. Since this is a raw code project using the pygame library, the way to run the game is by either using a programming environment (IDE) or running it directly from the terminal console. Here's a guide to it:

1 - Extract the .rar file and enter the space_challenge folder.

2 - Copy the path to said folder (the bar at the top of the files that tells where you are, treat it as a google link)

3 - Dowload python from the microsoft store if you don't have it already (version 3.11 or above)

4 - Install pygame library:
	- Open the terminal console window (search 'cmd' on the search bar next to the windows icon)
	- Type 'pip install pygame'

5 - Run it from the terminal:
	- Remember the path to the space_callenge you copied? On the terminal, type 'cd (paste the path)'. 
	Example: cd User\Dowload\space_challenge
	- Type 'python main.py'

6 - Run it from a IDE:
	- I use Sublime Text so that's the one I recommend dowloading
	- Open main.py and run it

If anything goes wrong, you want help, have question or want to contact me, don't be afraid to do so, any feedback is very welcome:
